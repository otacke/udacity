* Machine learning will intensify what [Gunter Dueck](http://omnisophie.com) has been preaching for ages:
  the "easy" parts of work will be done by machines - even in academic settings
  like teaching or medicine - leaving the "hard" parts for humans. Let's see
  if the socio-economic consequences of that thought will be discussed throughout
  the program as well.
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) hosts machine learning competitions sponsored
  by companies who then can get in contact with the teams that won. Open Innivation.
  Should definitely have a look!
* Teams and lone wolves.
* Prediction: many repetitive tasks will be done better by AI.
